        <h2>HTML</h2>

        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) <br>
        <br>Is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web. Invisible important information about an HTML document and website that is used by the browser so that the page renders correctly.
      
        <ul>
          <li>!DOCTYPE html declaration which tells browser document is written in HTML </li>
          <li>html represents the root of our HTML document</li>
          <li>head is opening element which contains metadata</li>
          <li>meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport that is used by the browser</li>
          <li>title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and shows up in tab</li>
          <li>style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>Script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
        </ul>

        An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. E.g. lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English).
        Similarly, meta element defines the charset, or character set, as UTF-8, which is a method of converting your typed characters into machine-readable code. <br>

        <br>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.<br>
        <br>The body element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the body element.
        The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. 
        Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page, or span to create an inline division. Sometimes these are simply the most efficient solution to a structural problem the developer is trying to solve.
        When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside (for example, head). Closing tags begin with a forward slash (for example, /head).
        The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.
            
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.
            The src attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.
            The alt attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages
            The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content          </li>
        </ul>

        Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading,h1, should only appear once on each page.<br>
        <br>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.
        HTML uses the id and class attribute as a way to identify elements and select them.

        <br>Repo - every project; a folder for your project that contains all of the files and their history
        <br>Branch - workspaces where you can make changes that dont affect the live site (create a new branch for your work and name it best to describe the work), work off latest version of branch; check what branch (not working off the main/master branch as this is typically is what is published to main site)
        <br>Markdown (.md) - the way content files are formatted in Github; a way to write for the web using plain text which easily converts to HTML
        <br>Commit changes - saving a new version of a file youre workin on; adds changes to your branch (whenever you add, edit or delete a file you are making a commit)
        <br>Pull request - asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch; and have someone take a look at it
        <br>Merge  - where a PR is approved, changes are pulled in or merged into the main branch 
        <br>Issue - way to report new tasks or content fixes which are tracked on project board
        <br>Fork -  concept of making copy of the main repository to your account so that you can make modifications in it. You can Submit pull request to the main repository with the modifications. It will make sure that the main repository is prevented from unwanted changes.

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git status: shows status of your working directory</li>
          <li>git init projectname:create a new local repository </li>
          <li>git clone projecturl: downloads a project from the remote reposistory</li>
          <li>git checkout -b feature/name: creates a new branch off main branch</li>
          <li>git chechout: navigate to specific file</li>
        </ul>

          <br> Git Branching <br>
    
          <br> The first step to creating a local development version is to create a feature branch. This is the branch where we will be adding our new code.
          Our default branch is called main, but master may also be seen in older repos. We shouldnt do any coding directly in the main branch. Instead, we will branch off of main and create a feature branch, which is a copy of the main branch. That way, we maintain the main branch and we can track the changes that were made to it via the feature branches.
          When we create a new branch to add something new to our project, we call it a feature branch. That is because we are adding a new feature or functionality to our app! <br>
